# 2023-Offseason-Robot-Code
During the offseason, we created a robot that can pick up and score hatch panels from the 2019 Deep Space and the 2017 Steamworks games. This is the repository of our project where we were able to practice utilizing state machines for the manipulator (hatch panel cascade, intake, wrist), PIDF tuning on 4 different subsystems, and velocity trapezoids.
